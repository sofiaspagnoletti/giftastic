### GifTastic

For this assigment, Giphy API was used to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs. 

## Getting started
The theme chosen for my app was "animals", the webpage shows buttons with some options of animals, when a button is clicked  10 gifs of the animal selected are displayed. The user can also add new buttons of their favorite animals to place new gifs to the page.
